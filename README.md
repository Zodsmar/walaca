This is just a fun app to mess with API's and see what can be put together using React.
The three built in apps will be a weather app, location finder (Geo coordinates), and currency calculator.

To use this you need to clone the repo and in the root folder create a .env file.
Inside the .env file you will need:

REACT_APP_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
REACT_APP_GEOAPIFY_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
